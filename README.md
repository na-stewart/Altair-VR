# Altair VR

![alt text](https://github.com/altairorg/xrprototype/blob/main/altair-vr.PNG)

The Altair VR Prototype is a web based VR experience developed for Altair Global. This project demonstrates how upcoming virtual reality technology can be utilized within the relocation industry. We accomplish this through different experiences that would be through the eyes of the employee being relocated. For example, a tour of Paris and a virtual apartment viewing. 

The initial spawn point is called the Altair Virtual Lobby (AVL). This is a model replication of the lobby of our office in Frisco, TX. Here you can read Altair Global's tweets, provide feedback via a VR X-Check system, and access the multiple comprehensive VR experiences this prototype has to offer.

Developed with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).
